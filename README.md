Hi Y'all
This is just a pet project I am working on in my spare time. I made a good friend while I was on vacation in Europe, but unfortunatly she lives in Australia. One day we came to the realization that she had never seen Star Wars. We tried to find a simple way to watch it together but couldn't seem to figure it out. That's where my idea for ShareTube was born. 
Currently I am only working on front end while I try to learn a thing or two about backend work in my spare time. The project is barely chugging along since I am really busy.
I would be happy to have some help since I have no idea what I'm doing especially when it comes to networking and other backend things. 
My goal is to have a semi functioning prototype by the summer of 2018 when I graduate so that I can continue to flesh it out from there.
One thing I really hope to be able to do in the future is work out a way to do Netflix and Hulu integration so that people can watch shows and movies together.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the wall of text.
